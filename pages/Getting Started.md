### New to Discord? Before you do anything else, go [here][0] to make an account.

This is a quick start guide to get you ready to use the UD CIS Discord for your courses.
There are more detailed instructions and documentation in the other pages, but this onr contains the basics.

Throughout this module, you can replace `000` with your course code. For example General Computer Science for Engineers
is CISC 106 so any `000` would become `106`. An honors section of CISC 106 would become `106-H`.

### Getting Verified

Before you can start sending messages, you need to get verified. In an email sent around the first week of classes, you will find a link to our server and a unique hash code.
Click the link to join the server and follow the instructions given in the <span style="color:#7289DA">#getting-verified</span> channel.
Once you have followed those instructions, you have officially been verified!

**IMPORTANT: If you are reading this before the first day of classes, please wait for our onboarding process to begin, typically a day before classes officially start, though some classes may not be added until up to a week after. _If you did not receive an invite, or if instructed by an Admin, you can fill out the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScvT1qb8yh2W8T2D1JK-QK_kaENRfg9UfXXV1YWQHydVg0d6g/viewform?usp=sf_link)._**

### Enrolling in a course

When you verify, Sage may let you know that you've been automatically enrolled in a course. If you have been automatically enrolled, great! You can skip the rest of this section.
If Sage didn't tell you that you were enrolled in a course, simply head over to <span style="color:#7289DA">#role_select</span> and find your course(s) in the dropdown menu.
Sage will enroll you into any course you select and you'll be given access to their course channels immediately. If you are taking more than one CISC class that is using Discord, don't worry, you can enroll in as many classes as you need.
