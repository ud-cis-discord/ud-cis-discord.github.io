## Welcome to the UD CIS Department!

To get up and running with the UD CIS Discord server, you'll need to complete a few steps to get verified with us.

1. **Accept your invite to the server.**
   - In the welcome email, there is a link to get onto the server and a hash code. Once you click the link, if you already have a Discord account you should log into it and proceed to the server. If you don't have a Discord account, you will need to [create one.][30]
   - **IMPORTANT: If you are reading this before the first day of classes, please wait for our onboarding process to begin, typically a day before classes officially start, though some classes may not be added until up to a week after. _If you did not receive an invite, or if instructed by an Admin, you can fill out the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScvT1qb8yh2W8T2D1JK-QK_kaENRfg9UfXXV1YWQHydVg0d6g/viewform?usp=sf_link)._**
2. **Getting Verified.**
   - Once on the server, you'll need to follow the instructions given in the <span style="color:#7289DA">#getting-verified</span> channel. After you do that,
     you will gain access to the full server!

If you have any problems with the above steps, please contact one of the guild's maintainers: [Blade](mailto:bladetyr@udel.edu), [Simon](mailto:sbrugel@udel.edu), [Leo](mailto:leochen@udel.edu), or [Matt](mailto:mattnadar@udel.edu).
